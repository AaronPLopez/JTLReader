# JTLReader
## Version 0.1.9.0
### Date: 2022/10/04

-------------------------------

#### Description 
JTLReader is a utility for taking (only) the JMeter Text Logs (JTL) results file from an Apache JMeter test and creating a spreadsheet-based report that charts several key metrics. One of the strengths of the report is that the tables and charts it creates isolates "transactional performance and throughput" from "requests performance and throughput". This can help with analysis as it highlights more focused "total transaction" metrics. A JTL file is typically generated by JMeter after a load test is executed via the CLI (e.g. through the "-l [name of JTL file to log sample results to]" option). JTLReader can also merge the data from a perfmon JTL file (generated from the "jp@gc - PerfMon Metrics Collector" extension) into the report to create a single source of analysis.
    
Currently, JTLReader is only a command-line only utility.
The generated report from JTLReader is a compliment to the auto-generated JMeter report.
The tool is made available in the .NET 6.0 portable runtime for Windows (win-x64), Linux (linux-x64) and macOS (osx-x64).
